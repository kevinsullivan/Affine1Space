This directly currently exports 1-D geometry as an affine space, with position and translation objects, and a supporting algebra with Lean-provided notations: for translation (vector) addition and scalaing, and for the affine-space operations of translation-position addition (vectors act on points by translating them) and position-position subtraction yielding translation. See geom_test.lean for a demo.

Note: This file and time.lean are going to be near repeats, varying in the names of the types of
the position and translation objects. Lot of repetition. What's the best way, if any, in Lean, to avoid repeating ourselves like this?
