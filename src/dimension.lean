Here we formalize the standard dimensional analysis concept of 
a physical dimension. We enumerate the basic dimensions of the 
SI system by name, then represent an arbitrary dimension as a
7-tuple of rational exponents corresponding to the enumerated
basic dimensions. It's well known that the algebraic structure
of this set is that of an additive commutative (abelian) group.

Next we define functions for computing derived dimensions. Then
we give standard physics names to a few derived dimensions. This
list can be greatly extended.
