We now create a distinction between Points and Vectors, which builds upon
the existing abstraction of affine points and affine vectors.

For example: 

GeometricPoint takes in some physical space, an affine point, and an affine frame
GeometricVector takes in some physical space, an affine vector, and an affine frame
