# Kevin notes

We consider replacing the concept of physical dimensions with that of physical spaces. As an example, we think of length as a basic physical dimension, but the set of (directed) lengths is really just the vector space component of a torsor of geometric points. What we want to do then is to replace the "dimension of length" with an "affine space of positions (points) and displacements (directed lengths)." 

Where this then goes is to the replacement of the concept of derived dimesions with that of derived spaces. We need an algebra of spaces, not of dimensions. The latter is fundamentally incomplete, or at least deeply impoverished as a framework for physical modeling.
